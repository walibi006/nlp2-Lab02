# NLP LAB 2 - Encoder-decoder model

Authors:
* Aurelien ROUXEL
* Ethan MACHAVOINE
* Jonathan POELGER

The project consists of 2 main parts:
  - Answer theorical
  - The implementation of an encoder-decoder model

Our implementiations consists of one files, `Lab02.ipynb`, which contains the answers to the theorical questions as well as the implementations.
it uses the following libraries:
  - `datasets` for the dataset
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning utils
  - `pytorch` for the RNN and learning
  - `torchtext` for vocabulary and tokenization
