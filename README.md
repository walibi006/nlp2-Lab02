# NLP LAB 2 - Encoder-decoder model

Authors:
* Aurelien ROUXEL
* Ethan MACHAVOINE
* Jonathan POELGER

The project consists of 2 main parts:
  - The theoritical part
  - The implementation of an encoder-decoder model

Our implementiations consists of one files, `Lab02.ipynb`, which contains the answers to the theoritical questions as well as the implementations.
it uses the following libraries:
  - `pytorch` for the Encoder-Decoder model
  - `torchtext` for vocabulary and tokenization
  - `sacrebleu` for encoder-decoder evaluation
